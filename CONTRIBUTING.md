# Contributors' Guide

💪👍 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute, you are amazing! 👍💪

This is a growing list of **resources** for learning and improving as a developer and/or designer and we want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible, whether it is:

- [**Adding Learning Resources**](#Adding-Learning-Resources)

- [**Proposing New Features**](#Proposing-New-Features)

## Prerequisites

- Git or any equivalent Version Control System
- Code Editor (VsCode, Sublime Text, Atom e.t.c)
- Little command line knowledge
- The zeal to share learning resources with others :blush:

## Getting Started

1. If you are new to Git and Github, it is advisable you go through
    [**GitHub For Beginners**](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/) and [**Basic Git WorkFlow**](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

## Adding Learning Resources

1. We have created a list of markdown (`.md`) files for different categories of learning resources. Find the category/categories related to the resources you want to add in the root directory

2. Check if the resources you want to add is already included. If not, then you can proceed!

3. Add your resources at the end, follow the pattern of the already existing resources. It should include:
    * **Name** of the resources (as a link to the resource page)
    * **A brief description** of its content and other related information.

    Here are **some examples**: <br>
    `- [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/): A 30-day coding challenge in which you will build 30 things using vanilla JavaScript`

    `- [mmtuts](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheCharmefis/featured): **_mmtuts_** (a.k.a MultiMedia Tutorials) aims to provide tutorials spanning the gamut of programming, video editing/production, animation, and graphic design.`

4. If you want to create a new category for your resources, kindly [**open an issue**](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/resources/issues) to let the project maintainers know of this new category before creating one.

5. Open a **pull request**, with a short descriptive `branch name` and `commit messages` 


## Submitting a Fix
